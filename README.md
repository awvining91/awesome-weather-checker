# Awesome Weather Checker!!!

## Find out if it's raining cats and dogs!

This site shows a cool, minimalist weather checker that gives you the info you need to plan your day and live your best life. This website is brought to you by my hard work and tears. Enjoy! :)

## Challenges

I had to start over many times since I struggled with learning how server side APIs work and I had a hard time with the documentation of openweathermaps. Youtube was very helpful in describing fetch requests and how they work and I even found some guidance on how openweathermaps works.

I had many challenges, mostly whenever I would add something, another thing would break or stop working. However as a concept server side APIs seem very interesting and I would like to improve my skills with them so I can build some cool things in the future. :)

## Next Steps

I started running out of time on this project since our first group project is starting very quickly and I wanted to wrap this up so I can be there for my teammates. Once the group project is squared away I would like to be able to in the future come back to this challnge and work at perfecting it.
